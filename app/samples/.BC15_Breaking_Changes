Breaking Changes

...and how to resolve them

In this help document, you will find a list of known breaking changes which were introduced in the latest major release. You will also get help on the changes you need to do to your code to make it compile again against the latest version of the Business Central System Application and Base Application.

Work in progress

The breaking changes are currently being identified. We will update this site with more help on this topic very soon.

{
    Caption = 'User ID';
    DataClassification = EndUserIdentifiableInformation;
    NotBlank = true;
    TableRelation = User."User Name";
    ValidateTableRelation = false;

    trigger OnValidate()
    var
        UserSelection: Codeunit "User Selection";
    begin
        UserSelection.ValidateUserName("User ID");
    end;
}


If you want to enable DrillDown for non-editable page, you need to use DisplayUserInformation from Codeunit "User Management"
field("User ID"; "User ID")
{
    ApplicationArea = Jobs;
    ToolTip = 'Specifies the ID of the user who posted the entry, to be used, for example, in the change log.';

    trigger OnDrillDown()
    var
        UserMgt: Codeunit "User Management";
    begin
        UserMgt.DisplayUserInformation("User ID");
    end;
}
