Exercise 1- Singleton Setup Table

    Create a new table with ID 50000 and name Example Setup using the Singleton Pattern
    Define field 1 Primary Key as Code 10
    Define field 2 Example Enabled Boolean
    Create Card Page 50000 Example Setup a. InsertAllowed = No b. DeleteAllowed = No c. OnOpenPage: RESET; IF NOT GET THEN BEGIN INIT; INSERT; END;
    Add the creation to Codeunit 2 and see if you can make this upgradable.
    Add a field to the user setup table Example Enabled (50000/Boolean)
    Create an Interface Codeunit returning the correct value based on Multi Level Setup

Exercise 2- Master Data Table

    Create a new table with ID 50010 and name Example Person
    Define field 1 No. as Code 20
    Define field 2 Name as Text 50
    Define field 3 Search Name as Code 50
    Define field 4 Name 2 as Text 50
    Add C/AL Code in OnValidate of Name field IF ("Search Name" = UPPERCASE(xRec.Name)) OR ("Search Name" = '') THEN "Search Name" := Name;
    Create cardpage 50010 Example Person Card based on table 50010
    Create listpage 50011 Example Person List based on table 50010 a. Editable = FALSE b. CardPageId = 50010
    Repeat the exercise for table 50020 Example Product
    Implement No. Series
    Implement Address Integration (In the appropriate Master Data)
    Add blocked entity field
    Redesign Address Integration to use an argument table
    Implement a product sales price table per person using the rules table

Exercise 3 - Journal Template Batch Line

    Import Exercise3.fob and study the objects
    Add the code to move the fields to the entry table in the Journal Post Line Codeunit
    Remove the Boat Anchor in Codeunit 50003 Ex. Jnl-Post line
    Create a new flowfield on the ExamplePerson table to study the automated entry creation by flowfields
    Create a new Entry table and enable the Autoincrement property. Run the table and see how it generates the unique key
    Add another field to the same table and enable Autoincrement. Study the results
    What other options are there to create a unique ID?

Exercise 4 â€“ Document

    Import Exercise4.fob
    Have a look at the document tables and how they are designed using the document pattern.
    Refactor the Post Codeunit as a method of the table
    Implement UI Separation
    Create the Post Action
    Import Exercise4a.fob
    Create a Hook function for the ExamplePostHook Codeunit, use OnAfterTestNear
    Create an event for the OnAfterTestNear function
    Import Exercise4b.fob
    Study the Query on Page object
    Refactor this on a report
